Privacy Policy  
===

Thank you for using Mousio! Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application.

## Information Collection

Mousio is a local macOS tool designed to help you control the mouse cursor using your keyboard. It allows precise cursor movement, grid-based navigation, multi-display support, and custom Dock-style launchers â€” all without requiring a mouse.

**Important Note:** Mousio is a fully offline tool. It does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The app runs entirely on your device and does not connect to external servers or third-party services.

### a. Local Data Only

- All Mousio settings and actions are processed and stored locally on your device.
- No cursor movement, key input, or configuration data is collected or shared.

### b. No Logging

Mousio does **not** generate or send logs. All activity and configuration remain on your machine and are never transmitted elsewhere.

## Use of Data

Since Mousio does not collect or store any personal data, there is no data usage or sharing of any kind. Your experience is entirely private and offline.

## Third-Party Services

Mousio does **not** use or integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or cloud services. No information is ever shared or sold to third parties.

## Data Security

Because Mousio stores all data locally and performs no external communication, your settings and usage are fully protected by your device's operating system security features.

## User Control

- You can delete all app data and settings at any time.
- Uninstalling the app will permanently remove all Mousio data from your device.
- There is no cloud backup or remote storage â€” you remain in full control.

## Changes to This Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If significant changes are made, we will notify you through the app or on the official repository. Please review this page periodically for the latest information.
